This is the logo of my favorite American brand. The man carrying the flag is Babe Ruth, one of my favorite players.
This place has everything: tees, prints, accessories. A good part of my wardrobe came from this store.
I have a few of their prints up around my apartment, which usually represent motivational posters or baseball jokes.
Some quotes include "Live life like a 3-1 Count" & "Pick Your Poison" with a diagram of pitch grips.
